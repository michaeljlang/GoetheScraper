GoetheScraper is designed to retrieve all bilingual text articles from the German-Spanish Kultur magazine.

GotheScraper was developed by Michael Lang through the PaCorEs research group at the University of Santiago de Compostela.

To run the code, execute the scrape.py file. This will create a new directory, "Goethe", where all files will be saved. 

GoetheScraper will save the articles in both .txt and .json format, resulting in four article files, two per language. A metadata.txt file and a links.txt file will also be generated.
